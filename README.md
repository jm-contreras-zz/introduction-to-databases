=========================
**Repository of SQL code that I wrote for the Stanford Online course [Introduction to Databases](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/about), a course that covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications.**

- **movie_schema_data.sql** creates three tables: Movie, Reviewer, and Rating.

- **movie_core.sql**, **movie_challenge.sql**, **movie_practice.sql**, and **movie_modification.sql** performa a variety of queries on the tables that **movie_schema_data.sql** creates.
