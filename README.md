introduction-to-databases
=========================
**Repository of SQL code that I wrote for the Stanford Online's [Introduction to Databases](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/about), a course that covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications. The scripts that create the tables used in these exercises, which end in "schema_data", were modified from similar scripts in the repository [dbclass-exercises](https://github.com/yangchenyun/dbclass-exercises).**

- **movie_schema_data.sql** creates three tables: *Movie*, *Reviewer*, and *Rating*.

- **movie_core.sql**, **movie_challenge.sql**, **movie_practice.sql**, and **movie_modification.sql** perform a variety of queries on the tables that **movie_schema_data.sql** creates.

- **social_schema_data.sql** creates three tables: *Highschooler*, *Friend*, and *Likes*.
